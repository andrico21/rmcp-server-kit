//! Memory-bounded keyed rate limiter.
//!
//! [`crate::bounded_limiter::BoundedKeyedLimiter`] wraps a map of per-key
//! [`governor::DefaultDirectRateLimiter`] instances behind a hard cap on the
//! number of tracked keys, with an idle-eviction policy and an LRU fallback
//! when the cap is reached.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! The `governor` crate ships a [`governor::RateLimiter::keyed`] state store
//! whose memory grows monotonically with the number of distinct keys
//! observed. For server use cases keyed by source IP this is a
//! denial-of-service vector: an attacker spraying packets from spoofed or
//! distinct source addresses can exhaust process memory regardless of the
//! per-key quota.
//!
//! [`crate::bounded_limiter::BoundedKeyedLimiter`] addresses this by:
//!
//! 1. Holding a [`std::collections::HashMap`] of `K -> Entry` where each
//!    `Entry` carries its own direct (per-key) limiter and a `last_seen`
//!    timestamp.
//! 2. Capping the map at `max_tracked_keys` entries.
//! 3. On insert when the map is full, first pruning entries whose
//!    `last_seen` is older than `idle_eviction`, then -- if still full --
//!    evicting the entry with the oldest `last_seen` ("LRU eviction").
//!    The new key is **always** inserted; honest new clients are never
//!    rejected because the table is full.
//! 4. Updating `last_seen` on **every** check (including rate-limit
//!    rejections) so an actively-firing attacker cannot dodge eviction by
//!    appearing idle.
//! 5. Optionally spawning a best-effort background prune task. Cap
//!    enforcement does **not** depend on this task running -- it is
//!    purely an optimization that reclaims memory between admission
//!    events.
//!
//! # Trade-offs
//!
//! - When a previously-evicted key reappears it gets a **fresh** quota.
//!   This is documented behaviour: a key under sustained load keeps its
//!   `last_seen` updated and therefore is never evicted; eviction only
//!   targets idle keys.
//! - The map uses [`std::sync::Mutex`] (not [`tokio::sync::Mutex`]) since
//!   admission checks must be synchronous and never `.await`.
//! - We do not log inside the critical section.
