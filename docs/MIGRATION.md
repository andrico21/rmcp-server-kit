# Migrating to the standalone `rmcp-server-kit` crate

This guide covers two migrations:

1. Moving from an in-repo `path` dependency to the standalone crate.
2. Upgrading from any `0.x` release to `1.0`.

## 1. Update your `Cargo.toml`

### Git dependency (development / pre-release)

Pin to a tagged release:

```toml
[dependencies]
rmcp-server-kit = { git = "https://github.com/andrico21/rmcp-server-kit", tag = "1.0.0", features = ["oauth"] }
```

### crates.io dependency (stable / production)

Use a caret range so patch and minor releases flow in automatically:

```toml
[dependencies]
rmcp-server-kit = { version = "1", features = ["oauth"] }
```

Avoid the exact-version pin (`version = "=1.0.0"`); it prevents security
patches from reaching your build.

## 2. Remove the workspace member

If `mcpx` was a member of your `[workspace]`, delete the `mcpx/`
directory and the `"mcpx"` entry in `Cargo.toml`:

```diff
 [workspace]
-members = ["mcpx", "my-app"]
+members = ["my-app"]
 resolver = "3"
```

If `my-app` was the only other member, consider flattening the workspace
to a single crate — see the host project's `docs/EXPORT.md` for the full
procedure.

## 3. Keep workspace-level lints in sync

`rmcp-server-kit` previously inherited `[workspace.lints.*]` from your root
`Cargo.toml`. After extraction, `rmcp-server-kit` owns its own lint table; the
downstream crate keeps (or promotes) its workspace lints independently.

## 4. Public-API changes

The extraction itself introduces **no breaking changes** in the public
API. Only stray doc comments and a hardcoded test hostname were scrubbed
(see `CHANGELOG.md` 0.9.30).

## 5. Build & verify

```bash
cargo update -p rmcp-server-kit
cargo build --all-features
cargo test --all-features
```

Expected: identical behavior to the pre-split build. If you observe
different `rmcp` version resolution, pin `rmcp` in your own `Cargo.toml`
to match the version declared in `rmcp-server-kit`'s `[dependencies]`.

## 6. Feature-flag parity

| Feature   | Meaning                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `oauth`   | Enables OAuth 2.1 JWT validation and token exchange.     |
| `metrics` | Exposes a Prometheus registry and `/metrics` endpoint.   |

Both remain opt-in to keep the default dependency footprint small.

## Migrating from 0.x to 1.0

`1.0.0` is the first stable release of `rmcp-server-kit`. From this point on the crate
follows strict [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/): no breaking changes
within the `1.x` series.

The `1.0.0` release bundles every breaking change accumulated during the
`0.x` series. If you are already on `0.13.x`, the upgrade is a no-op other
than bumping your `Cargo.toml`. If you are on an older `0.x`, review the
intermediate sections of [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) for the full
list of behavioural changes.

### Action items

1. **Rename the crate dependency and imports.** The crate was renamed from
   `mcpx` to `rmcp-server-kit` for the `1.0.0` release. Update both
   `Cargo.toml` and Rust import paths:

    ```diff
     [dependencies]
    -mcpx = { version = "1", features = ["oauth"] }
    +rmcp-server-kit = { version = "1", features = ["oauth"] }

    -use mcpx::transport::serve;
    +use rmcp_server_kit::transport::serve;
    ```

2. **Bump the dependency.** Switch to caret-`1` to receive future
    `1.x.y` patches and minor releases automatically:

    ```toml
    rmcp-server-kit = { version = "1", features = ["oauth"] }
    ```

3. **Re-run your build & tests.** Most downstream crates need no source
   changes:

    ```bash
    cargo update -p rmcp-server-kit
    cargo build --all-features
    cargo test --all-features
    ```

4. **Audit deny / warn lint suppressions.** `rmcp-server-kit` 1.0 enforces a stricter
   lint set internally; if you copied any `#[allow(...)]` attributes from
    pre-1.0 rmcp-server-kit source they may now be redundant.

5. **Review your TOML config files** against the schema in
   [`docs/GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md#configuration-via-toml). Any field that was
   removed during the `0.x` series will produce a deserialization error at
   startup; add or rename as appropriate.

6. **Re-pin compatible versions of `rmcp`, `tokio`, `axum`, `rustls`** to
   match the versions declared in `rmcp-server-kit 1.0.0`'s `Cargo.toml` if you saw
   resolver mismatches on `0.x`.

### What does *not* change

- Public module layout (`rmcp_server_kit::transport`, `rmcp_server_kit::auth`, `rmcp_server_kit::rbac`,
  `rmcp_server_kit::oauth`, `rmcp_server_kit::metrics`, `rmcp_server_kit::tool_hooks`, ...).
- Crate-root re-exports (`rmcp_server_kit::McpxError`, `rmcp_server_kit::Result`).
- The `serve()` / `serve_stdio()` entry-point signatures.
- Cargo feature names (`oauth`, `metrics`).
- The MCP wire protocol — `rmcp-server-kit 1.x` continues to track the latest
  stable Streamable HTTP transport from `rmcp`.

### Forward compatibility

Within `1.x`:

- New methods may be added to `#[non_exhaustive]` structs and enums.
- New variants may be added to `#[non_exhaustive]` enums.
- New optional Cargo features may be introduced.

These are explicitly **not** breaking under our SemVer policy. If you
match exhaustively on a non-exhaustive type or rely on a struct's exact
field set, expect to add a wildcard arm or use one of the constructor
helpers documented in the GUIDE.
